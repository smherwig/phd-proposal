\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%% big picture
Applications often assumes that a single party controls the application, its
data, and its execution environment.
%
This assumption is valid when a party develops the software, owns the data, 
and administers the deployment infrastructure.
%
However, when these applications must use a heterogeneous dataset,
such as data form multiple parties, or run under a different deployment, such
as on a third-party's cloud, the application's original assumption of a
monolithic trust setting is no longer valid.


%% statement of problem (why big picture murky)
Unfortunately, the operational status quo is either to ignore the issue, or
restrict the scope of such applications.  
%
For instance organizations outsource their applications to the cloud for
cost-savings or deployment flexibility, even though this decision exposes to
the cloud operators private data about the organization and its patrons.
%
Considerable data is confined to so-called data-islands.



%% challenges in solving it    (why does it remain murky)
Academia and industry have devoted considerable attention to the underlying
problems of secure remote computation and secure multi-party computation.
%
A major difficulty is that conventional operating systems and
programming languages offer limited support for developing and running software
that has an execution model based on heterogeneous trust.
%
Thus, much of the systems-oriented research in this area explores languages,
tools, and system designs for addressing and expressing this execution model.


%%  your insight
My insight is to apply ideas from alternative operating system
architectures that emphasize a distributed and application-specific execution
environment.
%
Whereas these architectures are motivated by stability, performance, or
maximizing use of idle resources, my focus instead is on using them as a means
for constructing and enforcing isolation boundaries that reflect the principals
and trust assumptions of the application.
%
Since the execution enviornment is transparent to the application, 
it may be modified, partitioned, or distributed across domains of varying
trustworthiness, so as to reflect multi-party security goals.
%
Transparency with respect to the application lends this approach to the
important and practical property of enabling \emph{post-hoc} refinements to an
application's security and privacy guarantees, without changing the
application's source code.
%%  your thesis
To that end, my thesis is:
\begin{displayquote}
    It is possible to run legacy application binaries with confidentiality and 
    integrity guarantees that reflect the potentially multi-party trust model
    in which the application is deployed.
\end{displayquote}


%% contributions you make
%Several factors strongly influence the design of such an execution environment:
%the presence of trusted hardware, the trust each party has in the application,
%and the mechanisms for defining and enforcing trust boundaries.
%
In my preliminary work, \textbf{conclaves}, I assume the availability of Intel
SGX secure hardware enclaves.
%
Conclaves extends prior work on SGX-based library operating systems (libOS) by
extending a libOS to support a broader set of legacy services: namely,
multi-process, shared resource, applications.
%
My extensions result in a distributed system reminiscent of a microkernel,
where each kernel service (for instance, a filesystem or shared memory)
runs in a separate enclave and mediates that serviceâ€™s shared resources
among the application's enclaved processes.
%
With conclaves, the trust policy is code-centric, as the parties specify which
processes comprise the system, as well as which processes may interact with one
another.


My proposed work, \textbf{codomains}, treats trusted hardware availability as a
policy concern.
%
Codomains maintain the source-level abstraction of a monolithic program, but
allow applications to dynamically switch execution to different domains---hosts
and enclaves---via language-neutral mechanisms.
%
Within a domain, the application may pin data to the domain or to a subset of
peer domains.
%
Although codomains present an explicit API for domain switches and data
pinning, the design allows a monitor to implicitly and transparently call such
functions on the application's behalf.
%
In its extreme, codomains allows the trust policy to be data-centric, with parties
specifing which data must be isolated from other parties and how data may flow
throughout the system.


%% description of the rest of paper, at a high-level
This proposal is organized as follows: in \S\ref{sec:background}, I describe
the problem setup, the threat model, and the system goals.
%
In \S\ref{sec:related}, I provide an overview of trusted execution
environments (TEEs), and techniques for running legacy applications
in TEEs.
%
I also describe techniques for data isolation and integrity that pre-date, or
are otherwise orthogonal to, TEEs.
%
In \S\ref{sec:conclaves-summary}, I summarize my preliminary work.
%
In \S\ref{sec:codomains-intro} I introduce the concept of codomains, as well as
a related concept of the coprocess, and in \S\ref{sec:codomains-design} sketch
their design.
%
I describe a set of evaluations for codomains in \S\ref{sec:codomains-eval}.
%
I conclude in \S\ref{sec:conclusion}.
