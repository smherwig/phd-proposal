%   We need cover concepts/problems that are common to all
%   the deployment stragegies, as well as define common terms here.

We define availability as the ability for a service to respond to
client requests at a desired quality of service (such as request latency),
as well as scale to a given throughput.
%
Thus, availability is an umbrella over the related concerns of
service scaling (as by service replication), load-balancing, and defense
against denial-of-service attacks.
