\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}


\subsection{Problem}

There are two broad flavors of outsourcing.
%
The first is an organization migrating their in-house service to a third-party
deployment; the second is an organization  moving from in-house services to
those offered by third party cloud service providers.
%
Of course, there are combinations between these two extremes, such as where
cloud service provider must communicate with some in-house backend services of
the organization.


Common examples are an organization moving their HTTPS, DNS, or email servers
into the cloud, or contracting some other party to run their own
implementations of these services on the organization's behalf.
%
Note that, nowadays, all of these core application-level protocols use public
key cryptopraphy to ensure either the integrity and/or confidentiality of the
applciation's underlying content.


Consider an organization that outsources its web hosting to a third-party,
such as a content delivery network (CDN)\@.
%
A CDN is a massive, global network of \emph{edge servers}, where each edge
server acts as a reverse proxy for the organization: to
handle client requests, edge servers retrieve content from the organization's
\emph{origin servers}, and cache it so they can deliver it locally.
%
CDNs derive much of their utility from the fact that they have servers close to
most clients, thereby providing low-latency responses.
%
CDNs also provide added security benefits, such as absorbing DDoS
traffic, and filtering targeted malicious trafic, such as SQL injection and
cross-site scripting attacks~\cite{securing-cdns}.
%
Virtually all of the most popular websites (and a very long tail of unpopular
websites) use one or more CDNs to help reliably host their content.


\parhead{Impersonation}
% concern 1
In any of either case, either the cloud infrastructure owner or the service
provider or both gain access to the private key the customer uses for all of
these services, and can thus perfectly impersonate the organization with
respect that service, to the extent of arbitrarily modifying content.


As the web moves towards HTTPS-everywhere~\cite{felt-2017-https}, organizations
increasingly rely on CDNs to store their HTTPS certificate and the
corresponding secret keys~\cite{key-sharing, when-https-meets-cdn}, so that
they can accept TLS connections while maintaining low latency to clients.
%
This has significant implications on the trust model of the PKI and the web
writ large: today's CDNs can arbitrarily impersonate any of their
customer organizations.

% TODO: shorten
Traditionally, an organization signs their DNS records offline, uploads them to
the CDN, and then uploads the DS records to the parent zone.
%
For convenience, though, an organization may outsource the keys and management
to the CDN\@.
%
With the organization's private DNS keys online, the CDN can offer
additional services, such as greater flexibility to return geographically-based
responses, as well as zone enumeration defenses.



\parhead{Breach of Confidentiality}
% concern 2
There's also a breach of inherent confidentially between the clients and the
organization, as the third party is now privy to all the usage statistics, the
client passwords and private data, and so forth.
%
The third party itself might further subcontract aspects of the deployment,
such that the total exposure is not appearnt to the client or organization.


As the CDN may have a rich backend of distributed caches, the organization
expects that if data flows over a non-endorsed stream, it flows only to
machines owned by the CDN that attest to the same data flow properties. 
%
Similarly, an email server may use a third-party virus or spam scanning
service.



\parhead{Latent Trust Assumptions}
% concern 3
An addition concern is hybrid deployments, where some processing occurs on the
third-party, and some on the organization's site.
%
Let’s assume that an organization has migrated its front- end business
applications to a cloud service provider, but that its database remains within
the organization’s network. 
%
Suppose that the several internal applications also use the database. 
%
Before migrating to the cloud, the database could trust that any connections to
it were from benign, internal tools; now, the organization must retrofit a
firewall and privilege model onto the database in order to guard against
potentially malacious or devious queries from the cloud front-end.
%Alternatively, policy compliance can rely on fine-grained access-control
%support in the underlying database management system (DBMS).  
%%
%Unfortunately, the extent of the support and the language used to express the
%policies varies across DBMSs.  
%%
%For instance, PostreSQL offers row security policies that restrict, on a
%per-user basis, which rows can be returns by queries, or inserted, updated, or
%deleted by data modification commands.  
%%
%In contrast, MySQL offers plugins for application-level firewalls and 
%data masking and de-indentification.
%%
%Often, to achieve a fine-granularity, these features must be encompassed
%through virtual tables.
%%
%For many NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, the underlying desing assumption is
%that the database operates on localhost, with trusted input, and the
%database itself offers does not offer a permission system.


\parhead{Correctness}
% concern 4: correcntess: e.g., DNSSEC providers not actually providing DNSSEC.


\parhead{Legal and Regulatory Restrictions}
% concern 5: legal, policy restrictions

\label{tab:trust-models}
\end{table}

We describe an idealized trust model from the perspective of an
organization that uses a cloud service that requires the organization's
sensitive data.


For simplicity, we assume that the service provider (henceforth, provider) and
the cloud machine owner are the same party, and that the provider administers
all software on the machine, including any system software, such as the
operating system, as well as the application.
%
An untrusted provider may deviate arbitrarily from the stated service, but
remains subject to standard cryptographic assumptions.
%
Likewise, untrusted software may deviate abitrarily from its stated purpose
and, in particular, may actively try to leak sensitive data.
%
We assume, however, that the software is bug-free, and thus the model omits
external actors, such as a remote attacker.
%
The application may be composed entirely of open-source components, private
components that are proprietary to the provider, or some combination thereof.
%
If trusted boot is available  (either via a TPM, or in the form of secure
enclave launch), we assume that the organization and provider can agree to run
a specific build of system software, and that such software is trusted and
bug-free.


Table~\ref{tab:trust-models}, shows the different possible trust models based
on whether the provider offers hardware enclaves, whether the organization
trusts the provider, and whether the organization trusts the provider's
software.


\parhead{Models we ignore}
In models 1 and 2, the organization trusts both
the provider and the software, and thus the application may be run in a
conventional environment.
%
Models 3 and 4 are nuanced, as the organization trusts the provider, but not
the software; the software itself might be proprietary, or simply too large for
the organization to properly vet.
%
We choose not to focus on these models as they either disobey an assumption on
the transitivity of trust (that is, a trusted provider deploying a non-trusted,
proprietary, application), or speak to the case of running buggy software,
the latter of which is both outside of our trust model and mitigated with
existing sandbox techniques.


\parhead{Models we focus on}
In model 5, the organization trusts the software, but does not trust the
provider to run it faithfully, and thus uses one of various
approaches~\cite{talos,haven,scone,graphene} to
run an unmodified legacy application in an enclave.
%
In contrast, in model 6, an enclave is not available (or not trusted to be
immune to side-channnel attacks).
%
This is the starting use-case for Gemini.
%
In models 7 and 8, where neither the provider nor the software is trusted, no
general prupose solution exists for an organization to securely use an
unmodified, legacy, application.


%For instance, the application may be composed of several components, some of
%which are trusted, and some are not; we assume that the organization
%trusts the components that interact with the senstive data.

In practice, Gemini's trust model is more nuanced, and the stringent
black-or-white depiction of ``trusted" is too coarse.
%
For instance, it may be the case that most of the application is untrusted or
otherwise proprietary, but the organization trusts a small portion of the
application, such as its cryptographic library.
%
This scenario is between models 6 and models 7 and 8, as the organization can
identify a small trusted computing base within the application.
%
Gemini handles this scenario, with enclave availability and enclave trust
treated as configuration details.


\subsection{Goals}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Support legacy customer applications}
    \item \textbf{Protect private keys}
    \item \textbf{Correctness:} Ensure that the provider is running the actual
        service as expected.
    \item \textbf{Support multi-tenancy}
    \item \textbf{Usefulness:} The majority of the application's execution must
        take place on the provider's machine.

    \item \textbf{Protect session keys and cookies}

    \item \textbf{Performance:}
\end{enumerate}


%    \item \textbf{Safety:} Only code that the principal trusts, running in an
%        environment that the principal trusts, can access data that the
%        principal has pinned or tainted.
%
%    \item \textbf{Liveness:} Migration does not stop the world.
