\begin{abstract}
% 3 - 4 nice paragraphs:
Web service deployment suffers from a tradeoff between availability and
security: in order to increase availability, the service must shift the
deployment to third-parties; however, by assisting in the deployment, the
third-party gains sensitive information about that service.


I ask whether it is possible to reduce, if not eliminate, this tradeoff.
% 
I propose to design and implement systems that allow a web service to off-load
deployment tasks onto untrusted third-parties, while maintaining the same
security guarantees as if the service was deployed in-house.  
% 
To reduce adoption concerns, my approach is to extend existent systems for web
service deployment, and preserve theses systems' division of
responsibilities between the cooperating parties, rather than propose new
architectures for the web.
    

I explore the problem from a cross-section of the available options for
deploying a web service.
%  
In particular, I investigate deploying a web service (1) over a content
delivery network, (2) as a Tor hidden service, and (3), on the
decentralized web.  
%    
Each option entails a different operating and network environment, and reflects
distinct service preferences with regards to privacy and persistence.
