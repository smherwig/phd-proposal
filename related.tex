% The idea is to first give a brief overview of Intel SGX and AMD-SEV, as well
% as the attacks on them to note that they are not panaceas.

\parhead{Attacks}


% Each solution operates at a differnet level in the stack, more or less.
% Handle TEE and non-TEE based solutions together.

\subsection{Application-Level Solutions}
% here, you can talk about program partitioning, both those that are aware of
% TEEs, and those that came before.


\subsection{TLS Solutions}


\subsection{Cryptographic Solutions}
% In addition to homomorphic encryption, also need to deal with verifiable
% computation.


\subsection{Execution Environment Solutions}
% se, here, you talk both about IFC as well as Running legacy applications in
% SGX.



% Prior work on SGX libOSes~\cite{graphene,scone,haven} make it possible
% to run legacy applications within an SGX enclave, but all of them
% either lack multiprocess support completely, or only support multiple
% processes in a restricted environment.

%
% Moved to prior work
%% libOSes refactor a traditional OS kernel into a user-land library that loads
%% the program.
%% %
%% The program's C library is modified to redirect system calls to the libOS; the
%% libOS either services these calls internally, or calls into the host kernel
%% when host resources are needed.
