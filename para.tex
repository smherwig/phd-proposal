\section{\emph{Para} Techniques for Conclaves and Gemini}
\label{sec:para}

TODO: If a developer knows that his applications is running in such an
environment, are there any design choices a developer can make for, say, better
performance or more flexible configurations?  Is this just a case of applying
good engineering wrt to modularization and encapsulation, or are there any
deeper insights?  Usually, the efficienty of these solutions comes from
avoiding needless context switches.  So, with Gemini, you would look to hints
that could prevent needless migrations or deadlock.  This might just be memory
allocators.  Additionally, since the policy monitors have to decode the data
(tls, parse), you might be able to have the application avoid some of this.
